Monoterm
========

Monoterm converts all terminal colors to monochrome.

Why?
----

I initially developed Monoterm to use with my e-ink display. As it converts
everything to greyscale anyway, terminal colors simply make text harder to
read. There may be accessibility uses for Monoterm as well.

Installation
------------

Install with [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/):

```bash
cargo install monoterm
```

Usage
-----

The basic usage is `monoterm <command> [args...]`. See `monoterm --help` for
more information and additional options.
