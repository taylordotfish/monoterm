Monoterm
========

Monoterm converts all terminal colors to monochrome.

white.](misc/monoterm.png)

Why?
----

I initially developed Monoterm to use with my e-ink display. Since it converts
everything to grayscale, terminal colors simply make text harder to read. There
may be accessibility uses for Monoterm as well.

Installation
------------

Install with [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/):

```bash
cargo install monoterm
```

Usage
-----

The basic usage is `monoterm <command> [args...]`. Generally you would use this
to invoke your shell; e.g., `monoterm bash`.

With the `--bold` option, text that was originally colored will be rendered as
**bold**. See `monoterm --help` for more information and additional options.
